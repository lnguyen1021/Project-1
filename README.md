# Project 1
For this project, we looked at data from Georgia Department of Education (GADOE) and Governor's Office of Student Achievements (GOSA). We were curious to see how school district revenues and expenditure affected a district's SAT scores. We hypothesized schools with that spent more would have higher SAT scores.
## Challenges
There were several challenges with our first dataset we collect from kaggle.com which had financial information from all school districts in the U.S. This dataset was very difficult to clean with several entries with different spellings representing one district. We decided due to time constraints to abandon this dataset and find a dataset that would be easier to clean.
